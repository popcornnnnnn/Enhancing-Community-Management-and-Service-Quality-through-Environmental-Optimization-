# Enhancing Community Management and Service Quality through Environmental Optimization: Insights from Demand-Supply Matching

The community environment significantly influences the quality of life for residents. This study addresses the pressing need to comprehensively understand and evaluate community residents' environmental demands to enhance their satisfaction and happiness in China. By employing a demand-supply matching framework, we analyzed data from 371 questionnaires collected in 10 communities in Wuhan. The random forest algorithm identified key environmental elements based on residents' needs, while the Multinomial Logit (MNL) model quantified their impact on community management and service quality. Key findings reveal: (1) Residents' autonomy, relationships within the community, community civilization, security monitoring, and optical fiber networks are vital for improving community management and service quality; (2) There is notable heterogeneity in the importance of different environmental elements; (3) While security monitoring and optical fiber networks are well-developed, enhancements in the human environment are crucial. The study suggests focusing on human environment improvements, implementing tailored environmental construction measures, and strategically allocating community construction funds to optimize management and service quality.
